#starterCXX
A starter project for modern C++ development

# Usage

TODO

## git
echo "# starterCXX" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git remote add origin https://github.com/prokraster/starterCXX.git  
git push -u origin master  
 
## CMake

### Set the Minimum CMake Version
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2.2)

Since we're using travis-ci which is using Ubuntu, we are limited to using CMake 3.2.2. We could install a new version of CMake using a Ubuntu Testing ppa, but this would heavily increase our build time.

### Set the Name of The Project
project(starterCXX)

This is just the Name of the Project. Don't worry about it.

### Enable Warnings

add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)

This allows us to show most of the warnings we want. You usually do not want to have any warnings at all in your Project, so make sure you get rid of them.

### Enable C++17
add_definitions(-std=c++1z)

Using this Definition, we tell the compiler that we want to use the C++17 features like std::optional and all the other great stuff.

### Set the Include Directory
include_directories(inc)

This tells CMake where to look for our Header Files. 
Our header files usually end with .h or .hpp.

### Set the Source Files List
set(SOURCE_FILES src/SampleClassA.cpp src/SampleClassB.cpp src/SampleClassC.cpp)

This is a List of every C++ Source file (usually ending with .cpp, .cc, .c) we use in our Project. 
Do not use file(GLOB) since this can lead to unnecessary Problems. Check https://youtu.be/bsXLMQ6WgIk?t=900 for more Information about this.
It is safer to explicitly list the Source Files we have implemented.

### Create the main target
add_executable(main_target main.cpp ${SOURCE_FILES})

This creates our target for the main.cpp File. We are not including main.cpp in SOURCE_FILES because then we would not be able to use the main function generated by the Testing Framework (catch).


### Unit Testing
set(CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR lib/catch)
add_library(Catch INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(Catch INTERFACE ${CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR})

enable_testing()
set(TEST_SOURCES tests/tests-main.cc tests/test-factorial.cc)
add_executable(tests ${TEST_SOURCES} ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(tests Catch)
add_test(Tester test)

First we tell CMake where he can find the catch.hpp file that contains everything we need for unit testing.
Since we've put the file in the tests/catch/ directory we save that Path in the Variable CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR. 
Then we create a Library called Catch and link the CATCH_INCLUDE_DIR with the newly created Catch Library.

With enable_testing() we Enable the CTest functionality. 
This allows us to run the Unit Tests just by executing the "ctest" command in the build directory of the project.
Then we create the unit testing target called "tests" and tell him with ${TEST_SOURCES} ${SOURCES} what files are needed for that target.
Our Test Library can then be linked with the unit testing target using target_link_libraries
Lastly we add the tests target to CTest using add_test
